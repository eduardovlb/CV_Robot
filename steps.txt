1. Python code for object detection using opencv;
2. Train it for detect and recognize some objects. (screws, pen drives, pens...);
3. Object detection using Raspberry Pi;
4. Code for the robot track and get the object, then put it in the proper place. Could be in arduino or Raspberry Pi;
5. Test in practice.


The idea is for the robot recognize objects and organize them. If it detects a screw, it will put it with others screws. If it finds a pen, it will put it with pens. Not sure which objects I'm gonna use, but firstly I need to get the code for it. Maybe I'll use some reinforcement learning for the tracking and organizing thing, but if it's too complicated I'm not doing it, training takes time.
